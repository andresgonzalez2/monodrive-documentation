## Installation

### Build Errors

Ensure that you have followed all the instructions in 
[getting started](Getting_Started.md). Cuda is a requirement to run the 
simulator, see [prerequisites](Getting_Started.md).

### Long Loading Time

monoDrive's Simulator has high quality graphics that will take some time to compile 
when opening for the first time. Please be patient.

### License does not work on new machine

Each license is for one machine's use only. Please contact us through email at 
support@monodrive.io or through a communication channel already established, 
so we can help you resolve this issue. 

### License is not found

Ensure that you have copied a valid license.txt file into the correct folder, and
 that the name of the file is `license.txt`.
