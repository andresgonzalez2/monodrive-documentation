# Batch Generator Dashboard

monoDrive's Batch Generator Dashboard provides the client with visuals of custom configurations and result viewing for better testing.  The monoDrive simulator is configured from the Client. Everything about the simulator can be configured, from the material properties, to the vehicle properties, to the sensor properties. The dashboard is designed to step through each configuration with pre-built and customizable properties. Once all configurations are made, deploy and run every combination of the properties selected in the simulation. Results show the status of the test after it has run, and keeps different batches organized for review. The Dashboard can be used as a local app on your computer or through the cloud.
