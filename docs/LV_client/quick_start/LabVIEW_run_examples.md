## Run the monoDrive Client- Examples

### Closed Loop Example

1. Click on the arrow on the top-left corner to start the client.

2. Move the car using the Steering and Throttle controls.

3. Change the direction of the car using the forward control.

4. Apply brakes using the Brake control.

5. Change the Weather profile using the up and down control.

6. Select a different position to start if desired.

### Replay Example

1. Click on the arrow on the top-left corner to start the client.

2. Change the Weather profile using the up and down control.

3. Use the browser button to find other scenarios, you can find them typically on:

*C:\Program Files\National Instruments\LabVIEW 2019\vi.lib\monoDrive\monoDriveClient\labview\trajectories*

### Replay Controls

1. Click on the arrow on the top-left corner to start the client.

2. By default the Autoplay will be set to False. Click on the Next button to see the first frame on the trajectory.

3. Click on Previous to go back one frame on the trajectory.

4. Change the Weather profile using the up and down control.

5. Use the browser button to find other scenarios, you can find them typically on:

### HIL Example

1. Click on the arrow on the top-left corner to start the client.

2. Change the Weather profile using the up and down control.

3. This example is meant to be used with Veristand or other real-time hardware.

4. Use the browser button to find other scenarios, you can find them typically on:
