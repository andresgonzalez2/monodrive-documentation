## Making Autonomous Vehicles Drive Safe
Generation of realistic scenarios and resulting sensor information for perception and planning system validation.

- Low latency networked vehicle control
- Parameterized vehicle dynamics models with run time physics modification
- Fast scenario regeneration, with super realtime replay
- Parameterized and accurate real time sensor emulation

## How It Works
monodriveâ€™s platform is designed to automate scenario test generation for planning testing.
