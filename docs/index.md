The monoDrive simulator is configured from the Client. Everything about the simulator can be configured, from the material properties, to the vehicle properties, to the sensor properties. Read more about the configurations for the [simulator](Simulator-Configuration.md), [vehicle](Vehicle-Configuration.md), and [sensors](Common.md).
